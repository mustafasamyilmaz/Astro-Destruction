# Astro-Destruction
A Unity 2d Project similar to the Classic Space Shooter Game. 
Involves Programming Concepts like OOP, Referencing other scripts etc. 
Has Several animations icluding playerMovement, Thrusters, PlayerDamaged, Explosion etc.
includes logical UI such as ScoreCounter Livescounter etc.
Consists of 9 C# Scripts Communicating with each other
You can collect 3 Power-Ups such as Shield,Speed and TripleShot Power-Up
I did not include The Design Assets since for Example the spritesheets/Frame- by Frame Animations are extremely large by quantity (not Datasize) and therefore would be unnecessary
